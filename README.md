# MS Excel things

Showcase of some of the MS Excel things I've previously done.

## Attribute Collator

Collates attributes from input data where each entry corresponds to one attribute for a specific item, with the output presenting all available attributes in one row for each item.

Also removes empty and duplicate attributes.

## Organization Hierarchy Formatter

Converts relational organizational data into a chart form.

Includes some error-checking such as:

- Checking for duplicate organizations.
- Checking for potentially missing relational links.
- Some capacity to identify corrupted input data.
